The easiest way to set up a koken site.

Dependencies:
  - docker (http://docker.io)
  - fig (http://orchardup.github.io/fig/)

Instructions:
  - clone this git repo
  - execute sudo ./bootstrap
  - use fig to manage your database and apache/php containers

Notes:
  - volumes/mysql-data will be mounted into the mysql container and used
    as its "datadir"
  - volumes/koken-webroot will be mounted into the apache/php container
    and house the koken site itself including uploaded images
  - both of the volumes can be tracked in the git repo, so by all means
    fork this to maintain your site. be careful of sharing it though, as
    your mysql password shows up in the koken-webroot directory
  - a random mysql password is generated by the bootstrap script and
    output on the console so you can enter it in koken's web setup
